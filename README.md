# TheBirthdayParadox
I'm currently learning about probability, and The Birthday Paradox was causing me some confusion.  So I put together two different functions to calculate the answer in different ways, with some debug text that can be optionally uncommented to look at the numbers involved at various stages of the calculations.  Making this helped me better understand not only The Birthday Paradox itself, but also the practical uses of sequences vs collections when computing probability.
